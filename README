UDP Remote Copy Client and Server

Michael Bottini

Building:

`make`

Running:

`server <port>`
`client <hostname> <port> <filepath> <localpath>`

For example,

./server 5954
./client localhost 5954 common.h new.txt

---

Extra Functionality:

Note the ability to resolve hostnames; you can put in an IP address if you want
as well.

Unit tests work on my home compiler (g++ 7.2.0) but not on the CECS compiler
(g++ 5.4.0).

If no path is provided, the client will send the output to stdout. This allows
a user to pipe the output to a file. Info and errors go to stderr.
